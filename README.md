# We Split

We Split is a study app made using SwiftUI, being part of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

The idea of this first project is study the basic concepts of a SwiftUI app, how we can create simple components, as text fields, segmented controls, pickers, text views.

Also, we use some property wrappers inside this project, such as `@State` and `@FocusState`.
